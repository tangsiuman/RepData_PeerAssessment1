steps <- tapply(data$steps, data$date, FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)
```

### 2. Plot the graph
```{r plot the graph}
qplot(steps, binwidth=1000, xlab="Total number of steps taken each day")
```

### 3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
```{r calculate the mean and median}
mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE)
median(steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```
